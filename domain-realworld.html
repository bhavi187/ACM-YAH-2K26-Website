                        <p>
                            Static delivery routes often fail to adapt to dynamic urban conditions. Traffic congestion,
                            weather changes, and unpredictable customer availability cause delays and inefficiencies.
                            Fuel consumption and carbon emissions increase unnecessarily. There is a need for a system
                            that intelligently adapts delivery routes in real time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Design a platform that dynamically optimizes last-mile delivery routes considering traffic
                            patterns, weather, and customer schedules. The system should analyze real-time data from
                            vehicles, GPS, and logistics networks. Optimization algorithms must reduce fuel consumption
                            and emissions while improving delivery speed. Drivers should receive real-time guidance and
                            route updates. The solution should be scalable for multiple vehicles and locations,
                            providing actionable insights to logistics managers.

                        <p>
                            E-commerce platforms face tension between security and user experience. Fraud prevention
                            mechanisms can frustrate legitimate users. Weak personalization reduces customer engagement
                            and loyalty. A solution is needed that ensures trust without compromising seamless shopping
                            experiences.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Develop a platform that intelligently balances fraud detection and user convenience. The
                            system should analyze transactions and user behavior to flag suspicious activities in real
                            time. Frictionless authentication and secure payment processes enhance the user experience.
                            Personalized recommendations and trust-building features increase customer satisfaction.
                            Data privacy and security measures must comply with industry standards. The platform should
                            empower both users and merchants with confidence in the e-commerce environment.

                            People often struggle to discover meaningful places around them beyond popular
                            tourist spots. Existing apps either show overcrowded locations or fail to adapt
                            recommendations based on a user-defined distance or exploration range.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Develop a software platform that enables users to explore nearby places by setting a dynamic
                            distance range and entering a specific budget amount they are willing to spend. The system filters
                            and displays places such as cafés, attractions, events, or experiences that fit both the selected
                            distance and the entered budget. Results update dynamically as the user changes the radius or budget,
                            allowing personalized and affordable exploration.
