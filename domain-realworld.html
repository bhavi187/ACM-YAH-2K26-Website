                        <p>
                            Static delivery routes often fail to adapt to dynamic urban conditions. Traffic congestion,
                            weather changes, and unpredictable customer availability cause delays and inefficiencies.
                            Fuel consumption and carbon emissions increase unnecessarily. There is a need for a system
                            that intelligently adapts delivery routes in real time.

                        <p>
                            Design a platform that dynamically optimizes last-mile delivery routes considering traffic
                            patterns, weather, and customer schedules. The system should analyze real-time data from
                            vehicles, GPS, and logistics networks. Optimization algorithms must reduce fuel consumption
                            and emissions while improving delivery speed. Drivers should receive real-time guidance and
                            route updates. The solution should be scalable for multiple vehicles and locations,
                            providing actionable insights to logistics managers.

                            E-commerce platforms face tension between security and user experience. Fraud prevention
                            mechanisms can frustrate legitimate users. Weak personalization reduces customer engagement
                            and loyalty. A solution is needed that ensures trust without compromising seamless shopping
                            experiences.

                        <p>
                            Develop a platform that intelligently balances fraud detection and user convenience. The
                            system should analyze transactions and user behavior to flag suspicious activities in real
                            time. Frictionless authentication and secure payment processes enhance the user experience.
                            Personalized recommendations and trust-building features increase customer satisfaction.
                            Data privacy and security measures must comply with industry standards. The platform should
                            empower both users and merchants with confidence in the e-commerce environment.

                            Plastic pollution is widespread, and cleanup efforts are often reactive. Waste fragments
                            into microplastics before detection, harming ecosystems. Manual monitoring is slow and
                            inefficient. There is a need for proactive, automated systems to identify and address
                            plastic pollution in real time.

                            Design an AI-driven system capable of detecting plastic waste in aquatic and terrestrial
                            environments. The platform should integrate sensors, drones, or cameras to monitor areas
                            continuously. AI models must identify different plastic types and pollution hotspots. Early
                            detection enables timely cleanup interventions and prevents ecosystem degradation. Data
                            visualization and reporting tools provide actionable insights for environmental agencies.
                            The solution should support scalable and sustainable waste management strategies.
