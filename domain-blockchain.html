                            Centralized data storage is prone to breaches, unauthorized access, and manipulation. Users
                            lack transparency and control over who accesses their personal or organizational data.
                            Sensitive information is often shared without proper consent, causing trust issues between
                            parties.

                            Design a blockchain-based framework that empowers users to fully own their data and manage
                            access rights. The system should use smart contracts to enforce permissions and ensure
                            transparency. It must maintain immutable records, support verifiable audit trails, and
                            preserve privacy. Multi-stakeholder access should be seamlessly handled, enabling secure
                            collaboration. The platform should reduce dependency on central authorities while ensuring
                            trust and accountability.

                            Global supply chains face issues like counterfeiting, fraud, and lack of transparency.
                            Customers and businesses cannot reliably track product origin, handling, or lifecycle
                            events. These inefficiencies reduce trust and make quality assurance difficult.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Build a blockchain-enabled system to record every product lifecycle event immutably.
                            Integrate IoT or QR checkpoints for real-time monitoring and verification. The system should
                            allow manufacturers, distributors, and customers to track provenance accurately. It must
                            detect fraudulent or tampered products and provide clear visibility into supply chain
                            operations. Transparency, accountability, and multi-stakeholder collaboration are key goals.
                            The solution should enhance trust while reducing counterfeiting risks.

                            Centralized identity systems expose users to identity theft, repeated KYC processes, and
                            misuse of personal information. Users have limited control over their digital identity,
                            creating privacy and security risks.

                        <p>
                            Develop a self-sovereign identity platform using blockchain to give users control over their
                            credentials. The system should enable privacy-preserving authentication without requiring
                            repeated verification by different services. It should support verifiable credentials,
                            zero-knowledge proofs, and cross-platform interoperability. Users should be able to
                            selectively share identity attributes while maintaining data confidentiality. The platform
                            should reduce dependency on central authorities, enhance security, and provide trustable
                            digital identity solutions for individuals and organizations.
